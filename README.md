# S9A1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.

Note: All output related files are under "src/app" folder.

## Problem Statement
1. Create a form with 3 input & 1 dropdown fields and a button.
2. The dropdown filed values should display on initialization using services.
3. The input and the dropdown fields should use Two-Way Binding. Create a model
for the fields and initialize them on ngOnInit().
4. Create a service for sending and retrieving the data.
5. Create a function which will bind with the (ngSubmit). Once you click on that
button, it should send the data in the parameter and it should display the data in
View.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
